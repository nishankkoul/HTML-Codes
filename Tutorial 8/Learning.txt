Inline elements are those elements who do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

Block elements are those elements that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves pushing any content that comes after them to a new line. 

A block element can become an inline element and vice versa using the display attribute in CSS.
